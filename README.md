# greencode

**greencode** is a next-generation code debugger and verifier designed to help developers write correct, efficient, and reliable software. By combining powerful debugging capabilities with formal verification, greencode empowers you to catch bugs early, prove critical properties of your code, and streamline your development workflow.

> **Notice:**  
> greencode uses code from [Code of Contract](CODE_OF_CONDUCT) for advanced program verification.

## Features

- **Interactive Debugger:** Step through your code, set breakpoints, inspect variables, and analyze execution flow with an intuitive interface.
- **Code Verifier:** Formally prove properties about your code, such as correctness, safety, and invariants, to ensure reliability.
- **Multi-language Support:** Designed to work with modern programming languages, with an emphasis on verified and safe code.
- **Integration Friendly:** Easily integrates with your favorite editors and build tools.
- **Modern, User-friendly UI:** Clean, accessible user interface for seamless debugging and verification experiences.
- **Wiki Documentation:** Comprehensive guides, tutorials, and technical reference are available via the [project's GitHub Wiki](../../wiki).

## Why greencode?

- **Catch Bugs Early:** Find and fix issues before they reach production.
- **Increase Confidence:** Use formal methods to prove the absence of critical bugs.
- **Boost Productivity:** Intuitive tools help you debug and verify faster than ever.
